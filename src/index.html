            Usually, we don’t want to care about the mouse moving to child elements.
            All we want is to know when the mouse enters the element and when it leaves.

            There are mouseenter and mouseleave events to handle this, described in DOM Level 3 specification and supported by IE.

            For the rest of the browsers, we need to filter out mouseouts to children. The standard trick is to check the relatedTarget, and do nothing if we are still inside the parent.

            In the example below, we use mouseout for all browsers, but filter it through isOutside which ascends through parents of relatedTarget until it either meets the parent (this means we’re inside) or reaches the top node (we’re outside).
